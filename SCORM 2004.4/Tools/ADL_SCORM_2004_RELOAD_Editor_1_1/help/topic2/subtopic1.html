The RELOAD Editor is written in Java and the install file includes a copy of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which is installed under the RELOAD Editor installation directory.  This JRE (v1.4.1) should not interfere with other Java Virtual Machines installed elsewhere on your system.</p>
<P>As the software is written in Java it will ultimately be possible to run the RELOAD Editor on any platform (mac, linux, windows), however at present only a Windows and Macintosh installer is provided.  To date there has been no significant testing of the tools on Linux. In time we will seek to rectify this.</P>
<P>
<span class="SUBHEAD">Windows Requirements</span><br>
To run RELOAD Editor you should have a PC with at least the following specification:
<ul>
<li>Intel Pentium 3 (or equivalent) Processor, 800Mhz,
<li>256 Mb RAM,
<li>Microsoft Windows 95, 98, Me Windows NT4.0, Windows 2000 or Windows XP,
<li>A Web Browser for viewing Content Packages.
</ul>
