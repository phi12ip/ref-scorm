The IMS VDEX (Vocabulary Definition Exchange) draft specification (<a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/vdex/" target="_top">http://www.imsglobal.org/vdex/</a>), released in September (final release expected 15 November 2003) covers the mapping of vocabularies between different domains to facilitate interoperability of metadata records. At Heriot-Watt University, Phil Barker and Tina Manoharan have started work on creating a VDEX editor built on top of RELOAD. Whilst by no means a finished product, anyone interested in this specification should visit their web page to find out more and download the latest build. The tools, and further information is available from: <a href="http://www.icbl.hw.ac.uk/vdex/" target="_top">http://www.icbl.hw.ac.uk/vdex/</a>
