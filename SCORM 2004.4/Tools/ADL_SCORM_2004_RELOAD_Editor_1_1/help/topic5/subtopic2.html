To understand fully the facilities offered by RELOAD Editor, you must create and work with content packages.  The pages which follow lead you through all the stages in creating a simple content package.  If you wish to have a look at the content package that is created by the Content Package tutorial you can find the final file online here: <a href="http://www.reload.ac.uk/ex/testpkg.zip">http://www.reload.ac.uk/ex/testpkg.zip</a> (140k).  Either unzip the file and look at the individual files in your file browser, or use the RELOAD Editor to open this content package.</p>
<P><span class="SUBHEAD">Opening an Existing Content Package</span><br>
If you wish to open an existing content package choose File, Open from the File menu.  This displays a dialogue box which prompts you to choose either a Zip file or .xml manifest.  If you choose a Zip file, you will be asked to choose a folder to unzip to, and this will subsequently become the working directory for the Content Package. Dragging a Zip file (or imsmanifest.xml) onto the RELOAD workspace can be used to quickly open packages.
