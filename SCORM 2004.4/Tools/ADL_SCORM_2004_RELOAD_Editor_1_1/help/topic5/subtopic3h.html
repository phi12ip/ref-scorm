Although the content package (as held in c:\cp\testpkg\) is now complete and valid, we still need to save it and store as a zip.
<ul>
<li>Saving the content package is simple - press the Save Icon, or select Save from the File menu. You effectively defined the filename (package location) at the start of the session. You can view the manifest again now: select the manifest.xml file in the Resources Pane, and click on the view file icon in the Resource Pool toolbar.  You will see the same structure that you can see in the resources pane, along with all the metadata.  
<li>Saving the Zipped Content Package is simple too. Click the 'Zip Content package' Icon (or select 'Zip Content Package' from the File Menu. in the dialogue that appears, type a filename (including extension - .zip) and choose a directory - c:\cp (ie the level above the content) is convenient. 
</ul></p>
<p>Use Windows Explorer to navigate to the c:\cp directory.  Find the file and open it with WinZip.</p>
